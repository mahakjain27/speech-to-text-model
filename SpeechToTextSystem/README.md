# Speech-to-Text System with Integrated Language Modeling

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a speech-to-text system integrated with a language model to improve transcription accuracy. The project is divided into the following phases:

### Phases

1. **Setup & Planning**
   - Python environment setup
   - Required libraries installation

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Text data preprocessing for language model
   - Audio data preprocessing for acoustic model

3. **Model Training**
   - Train trigram-based language model
   - Train acoustic model (HMM or Wav2Vec2)

4. **Integration**
   - Use language model to refine raw transcription

5. **Visualization & Evaluation**
   - Plot confusion matrix, WER, accuracy
   - Use Power BI or matplotlib/seaborn

6. **Optional Web Demo**
   - Flask or Streamlit app for audio upload and transcription display

## Getting Started

Install required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Next Steps

Start with building the language model or acoustic model as preferred.
